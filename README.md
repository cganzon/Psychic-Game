# Psychic Game

This is a simple guessing game where the computer picks a random letter from the alphabet and the user is supposed to guess what letter the computer picked in a certain amount of tries. 

The UI consists of the wins, losses, guesses left, and guessed letters. As the user keeps guessing a letter, the letter is kept track of and displayed on the screen. The UI will continue to do this until either the user guesses the correct letter or until the user runs out of guesses. At either point, the appropirate win/loss score will be incremented and the displayed guesses will be reset. The computer will pick a new random letter and the game will continue.
